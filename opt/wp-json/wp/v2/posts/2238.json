Many candidates cannot reach the companies as they worry about the trust in candidates and the profile they receive.\n<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a particular agency is trusted and has good credibility in the market, companies can hire candidates through that specific agency for <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/\"><b>W2 and C2C Jobs<\/b><\/a>. Hence, candidates with transparent background verification can be charged for <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/\"><b>W2 and C2C Jobs<\/b><\/a>.

They are differentiated based on the usage. There are two types of contractual RTR. These Contracts are based on the need of a person that needs to be represented for <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/\"><b>Contract Jobs in the USA<\/b><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Single-position contract type<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single position contracts are used when you are qualified for a particular job position that a specific company gives. In such a case, you need to provide the authority to represent a particular recruiter. The recruiter will send across the details of all the candidates to the concerned client company for the recruitment process for <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/jobs\/\"><b>OPT Jobs<\/b><\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/\"><b>Contract Jobs in the USA<\/b><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this contract agreement, the recruiter will provide a document to sign which binds for a specific time-bound for a particular job position. This contract agreement will be tied for only one <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/jobs\/\"><b>OPT<\/b><\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/\"><b>Contract Jobs in the USA<\/b><\/a> and job position, and the candidate is free to contact the different recruiters.\n<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Broad Contracts<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The broad contracts are exactly comprehensive as it sounds.

It helps you go through multiple job vacancies and try at different companies when it comes to broad agreements, but it is limited to a single agency. That means you have to be in the hands of that one particular agency until you get the <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/\"><b>W2 and C2C Jobs<\/b><\/a> &amp; <a href=\"https:\/\/americanopt.com\/jobs\/\"><b>OPT Jobs<\/b><\/a>.
